        <h2 id="About Me">About Me</h2>
        <p class="aside">I am a resident of Illinois in a small town about an hour south of Chicago. 
        Since graduating from Augustana College, I have worked and gained many skills in the 
        Customer Service Industry. I have over ten years of combined experience in this field during 
        my time as a Lifeguard/Supervisor for our local beach, working as a service technician 
        for a pool company, and as a delivery driver for a local pizza place in my hometown. 
        I am also a licensed and certified Emergency Medical Technician for the state of Ilinois.</p>

       <h2 id="Education">Education</h2>
       <p class="aside"> I studied at and recieved my Bachelors degree from Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois.  
        My B.A. was in Business Administraion with a focus in Marketing with a Minor in Graphic Design.  
        My skills garnered from my schooling cater to the Marketing field as a whole but focused on Advertising and the production of film and digital media.  
        Most of my work has been done within the Adobe Creative Suite programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, Lightroom, Flash, Promeire, and AfterEffects.  
        During my time at Augustana, my class projects, participation in Greek Life, and completing three different internships allowed me to gain 
        over three years of experience in designing creative briefs for clients, shirts and flyers for events, and develop a variety of skills with video production, apparel design, and digital media production.
        Futhermore, I have completed a program to receive me emergency medical technician - basic certificate and work as a trained EMT-B in the state of Illinois.  Last but not least, I am participating in the 
        web development bootcamp through Northwestern University to pursue a future career in the Web Development field. <span> <a href= "./education.html">Here are some examples of my work.</a></span></p>
